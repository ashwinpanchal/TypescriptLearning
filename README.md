# TypeScript
### Starting
- You must install typescript in your PC (Refer to any youtube video)
- Make a `index.ts` file , this is basically your typescript file
- Run the command `tsc --init`, it will make a `tsconfig.json` file
    - Inside the `tsconfig.json` file you can make changes but let it be
- `tsc` is a compiler to convert typescript into javascript 
- When we run command `tsc` it converts all of `.ts` files to `.js` files

#### Day 1

- Typescript is the superset of javascript
- Types by inference
- Interface & Type
- Type are used for union of more primitive types or interfaces
